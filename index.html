            Despite being one of the largest animals, Elephants happen to be one
            of the selfless and defentless animals in the world. Almost every
            elephant face a threat of extinction from human beings.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we were to count the number of elephants today, it would be
            dispointing to find how much harm man has done to them. If only we
            could wake up and open our eyes, we would see that man was created
            to protect nature. But unfortunately thatâ€™s not the case these days.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, I would like to orient you on these wonderful
            animals. I will take you on the journey around the world and open
            your eyes on the different types of elephants and so on.
